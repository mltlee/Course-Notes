\subsection{Trees}\label{subsec:2.1}
A {\bf tree} is a connected acyclic graph; that is, a connected graph 
containing no cycles.

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a {\bf spanning tree} of $G$ is a graph $T = (V, F)$ 
such that $F \subseteq E$ and $T$ is a tree. We illustrate an example of a 
graph $G$ with a subtree $T$ using bold edges below. 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={15mm}, main/.style = {draw, circle}] 
        \node[main] (1) {}; 
        \node[main] (2) [right of=1] {};
        \node[main] (3) [below left of=1] {};

        \draw [line width=2pt] (2) -- (4);
        \draw (2) to [out=0, in=45, looseness=2] (7);
        \draw [line width=2pt] (3) -- (5);
        \draw [line width=2pt] (4) -- (7);
        \draw [line width=2pt] (5) -- (6);
        \draw [line width=2pt] (6) -- (7);
    \end{tikzpicture} 
\end{center}
In an introductory graph theory course, such as MATH 239, 
it is shown that every tree on $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges. The following 
theorem then gives us a useful characterization of trees. 

\begin{theo}[Fundamental Theorem of Trees]{theo:2.1}
    Let $T = (V, F)$ be a graph. The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $T$ is a tree. 
        \item $T$ is connected and $|F| = |V| - 1$. 
        \item $T$ is acyclic and $|F| = |V| - 1$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theo}

In particular, if we know that two of the conditions hold, then the 
third one is guaranteed.

\subsection{Minimum Spanning Trees}\label{subsec:2.2}
Given a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ and edge costs $c_e \geq 0$ for each 
$e \in E$, our goal is to find a spanning tree $T$ of minimum cost 
\[ c(T) := \sum_{e \in T} c_e. \] 
First, we'll set some notation. For a vertex $v \in V$, we define 
$\delta(v)$ to be the set of edges in $E$ incident to $v$. More generally, 
given a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$, the {\bf cut induced by $S$} is 
defined to be the set 
\[ \delta(S) := \{uv \in E : u \in S,\, v \notin S\}. \] 
The following theorem will be extremely important for finding a minimum 
spanning tree. 

\begin{theo}[Cut Property]{theo:2.2}
    Suppose that the costs $c_e \geq 0$ for $e \in E$ are distinct. 
    Let $S \subseteq V$ be such that $S \neq \varnothing$ and $S \neq V$, 
    and let 
    \[ e = \argmin_{f \in \delta(S)} c_f. \] 
    Then every minimum spanning tree contains the edge $e$. 
\end{theo}
\begin{pf}[Theorem~\ref{theo:2.2}]
    We proceed by contradiction. Let $S \subseteq V$ be such that $S 
    \neq \varnothing$ and $S \neq V$, and let $e = \argmin_{f\in S} c_f$. 
    Suppose that there is a minimum spanning tree $T = (V, F)$ such that 
    $e \notin F$. 

    Consider the graph $(V, F \cup \{e\})$. Note that $|F \cup \{e\}| = |V|$ 
    and this graph is connected, so it cannot be a tree by Theorem~\ref{theo:2.1}. 
    In particular, it must contain a cycle $C$. 

    Next, note that $|C \cap \delta(S)|$ must be even because for any 
    edge leaving the cut $\delta(S)$, there must be another edge coming back 
    into the cut. Moreover, since $e \in C \cap \delta(S)$, we have 
    $C \cap \delta(S) \neq \varnothing$. This implies that 
    $|C \cap \delta(S)| \geq 2$, so there is another edge $e' \neq e$ 
    with $e' \in C \cap \delta(S)$.

    Consider now the graph $T' = (V, (F \cup \{e\}) \setminus \{e'\})$. 
    Then $|(F \cup \{e\}) \setminus \{e'\}| = |F| = |V| - 1$ and $T'$ is 
    connected because if a path between two vertices used the edge $e'$, 
    then we could go along the edges in $C \setminus \{e'\}$ instead. 
    So by Theorem~\ref{theo:2.1}, $T'$ is also a spanning tree. 
    Finally, observe that 
    \[ c(T) - c(T') = c_{e'} - c_e > 0 \] 
    because we have $e = \argmin_{f\in S} c_f$ and $e' \neq e$ with 
    $e' \in \delta(S)$, as well as the assumption that the edge 
    costs $c_e$ for $e \in E$ were distinct. But $T'$ has lower cost 
    than $T$, contradicting our assumption that $T$ was a minimum 
    spanning tree. \qed
\end{pf}\vspace{-0.25cm}

The following property relating cycles to minimum spanning trees 
can also be proved similarly to Theorem~\ref{theo:2.2}. 
The main idea is to try to create shortcuts using the edges in the cycle. 

\begin{theo}[Cycle Property]{theo:2.3}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be connected with distinct edge costs 
    $c_e$ for $e \in E$. Let $C$ be a cycle in $G$ and let 
    \[ e = \argmax_{f\in C} c_f. \] 
    Then no minimum spanning tree contains the edge $e$. 
\end{theo}

\subsection{Prim's Algorithm}\label{subsec:2.3}
Prim's algorithm takes the idea of the cut property (Theorem~\ref{theo:2.2}) 
and uses it to compute a minimum spanning tree starting from an arbitrary 
vertex $s \in V$. At each iteration of the algorithm, we will keep track of a 
set of a partial tree construction $T$ and vertices $A \subseteq V$ that are 
connected to $s$ in $T$.

{\bf Input.} A graph $G = (V, E)$ and edge costs $c_e \geq 0$ for 
all $e \in E$. 

{\bf Output.} A minimum spanning tree of $G$.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.75cm, label={Step \arabic*.}]
    \item {\bf Initialization.} Let $s \in V$ be an arbitrary vertex, 
    then set $A \gets \{s\}$ and $T \gets \varnothing$.

    \item While $A \neq V$:
    \begin{enumerate}[label={Step 2.\arabic*.}]
        \item {\bf Pick an edge for the minimum spanning tree.} 
        Set 
        \[ e \gets \argmin_{f \in \delta(A)} c_f, \] 
        where $e = uv$ with $u \in A$ and $v \notin A$.  
        \item {\bf Update values.} Set $A \gets A \cup \{v\}$ and 
        $T \gets T \cup \{e\}$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}\vspace{-0.15cm}

Let's run Prim's algorithm on a simple example. Consider the following 
graph $G = (V, E)$, and suppose that at Step 1, we pick $v_1$ to be 
the initial vertex. 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={30mm}, main/.style = {draw, circle}] 
        \node[main, color=blue] (1) {$v_1$}; 
        \node[main] (2) [right of=1] {$v_2$};
        \node[main] (3) [right of=2] {$v_3$}; 
        \node[main] (4) [below of=1] {$v_4$};
        \node[main] (5) [right of=4] {$v_5$};

        \draw (1) -- node[midway, above] {1} (2);
        \draw (2) -- node[midway, above] {3} (3);
        \draw (1) -- node[midway, left] {4} (4);
        \draw (2) -- node[midway, above left] {2} (4);
        \draw (2) -- node[midway, right] {5} (5);
        \draw (3) -- node[midway, below right] {1} (5);
        \draw (5) -- node[midway, above] {4} (4);
    \end{tikzpicture} 
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
Then at the first iteration of Step 2.1, we have $\delta(A) = 
\{v_1v_2, v_1v_4\}$, so we pick $e = v_1v_2$ because it has minimum cost.
At Step 2.2, we set $A = \{v_1, v_2\}$ and $T = \{v_1v_2\}$. 

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={30mm}, main/.style = {draw, circle}] 
        \node[main, color=blue] (1) {$v_1$}; 
        \node[main, color=blue] (2) [right of=1] {$v_2$};
        \node[main] (3) [right of=2] {$v_3$}; 
        \node[main] (4) [below of=1] {$v_4$};
        \node[main] (5) [right of=4] {$v_5$};

        \draw[color=blue] (1) -- node[midway, above] {1} (2);
        \draw (2) -- node[midway, above] {3} (3);
        \draw (1) -- node[midway, left] {4} (4);
        \draw (2) -- node[midway, above left] {2} (4);
        \draw (2) -- node[midway, right] {5} (5);
        \draw (3) -- node[midway, below right] {1} (5);
        \draw (5) -- node[midway, above] {4} (4);
    \end{tikzpicture} 
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
The edge $v_2v_4$ is of minimum cost in the cut induced by $A$, so 
we set $A = \{v_1, v_2, v_4\}$ and $T = \{v_1v_2, v_2v_4\}$ at the next iteration. 
Continuing in this fashion, we obtain the following minimum spanning tree.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={30mm}, main/.style = {draw, circle}] 
        \node[main, color=blue] (1) {$v_1$}; 
        \node[main, color=blue] (2) [right of=1] {$v_2$};
        \node[main, color=blue] (3) [right of=2] {$v_3$}; 
        \node[main, color=blue] (4) [below of=1] {$v_4$};
        \node[main, color=blue] (5) [right of=4] {$v_5$};

        \draw[color=blue] (1) -- node[midway, above] {1} (2);
        \draw[color=blue] (2) -- node[midway, above] {3} (3);
        \draw (1) -- node[midway, left] {4} (4);
        \draw[color=blue] (2) -- node[midway, above left] {2} (4);
        \draw (2) -- node[midway, right] {5} (5);
        \draw[color=blue] (3) -- node[midway, below right] {1} (5);
        \draw (5) -- node[midway, above] {4} (4);
    \end{tikzpicture} 
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
Note that Prim's algorithm may seen similar to Dijkstra's algorithm 
which also yields a spanning tree in the process of computing shortest paths. 
However, these algorithms fundamentally solve different problems, and 
there are examples where the resulting spanning trees do not coincide. 
Moreover, Dijkstra's algorithm takes a directed graph as input, 
whereas Prim's algorithm takes an undirected graph. 

Next, let's prove that this indeed gives us a minimum spanning tree. 
For simplicity, we will assume that all edge costs $c_e$ for 
$e \in E$ are distinct. 

\begin{pf}[correctness of Prim's algorithm]
    At every iteration of Step 2, we add one edge to $T$, and we run 
    through $|V| - 1$ iterations. Therefore, $T$ has exactly 
    $|V| - 1$ edges. Moreover, an invariant of Prim's algorithm is that 
    all vertices in $A$ remain connected to $s$, so the final output is 
    also connected. Therefore, we indeed obtain a spanning tree by 
    Theorem~\ref{theo:2.1}. Finally, by the cut property (Theorem~\ref{theo:2.2})
    and our assumption that all the edge costs are distinct, $T$ contains 
    only the edges that are in every minimum spanning tree, so $T$ 
    itself is a minimum spanning tree. \qed 
\end{pf}

As a consequence, we also have the following useful result. 

\begin{cor}{cor:2.4}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph with distinct edge costs $c_e$ for 
    $e \in E$. Then $G$ has a unique minimum spanning tree.
\end{cor}

As usual, let's consider the running time, denoting $|V| = n$ 
and $|E| = m$ as before. For an efficient implementation, 
we keep track of a key $d'(v)$ for each $v \in V \setminus A$. 
Once a vertex $w$ is added to $A$ in Step 2.2, we update the keys via 
$d'(v) \gets \min\{d'(v), c_{wv}\}$ for each $v \in V \setminus A$. 

Note that Step 1 takes $O(1)$ time, and 
there are $n-1$ iterations of Step 2. Implementing Prim's algorithm 
using priority queues, we note that each iteration of Step 2.1 
involves one \textsc{Extract-Min} call, and 
going through all iterations of Step 2.2 takes at most $m$ 
\textsc{Decrease-Key} calls in total. We recall that by using Fibonacci heaps, 
\textsc{Decrease-Key} is $O(1)$ and \textsc{Extract-Min} is $O(\log n)$, 
so we have a total running time of $O(n\log n + m)$.
