\section{Network Design Problem} \label{sec:7}

\subsection{The Framework of a Network Design Problem} \label{subsec:7.1}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a 
graph with nonnegative costs $c_e \geq 0$ for all $e \in E$. 
Suppose we have some ``cut requirement'' function $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$. 
The goal of the network design problem is to minimize 
\[ c(F) = \sum_{e \in F} c_e \] 
such that $F \subseteq E$ and $|F \cap \delta(S)| \geq 1$ for all $S 
\subseteq V$ satisfying $f(S) = 1$. 

We say that a function $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ is {\bf proper} if 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $f(V) = 0$;
    \item $f(V \setminus S) = f(S)$ for all $S \subseteq V$;
    \item $f(A \cup B) \leq \max\{f(A), f(B)\}$ for all nonempty
    subsets $A,B \subseteq V$ such that $A \cap B = \varnothing$. 
\end{enumerate}
Let's look at a few examples of network design problems with 
respect to proper cut requirement functions. 

{\bf Shortest $s,t$-paths.} Recall from CO 250 that the shortest $s,t$-path 
problem can be formulated as the IP 
\begin{align*}
    \min\quad & \sum_{e\in E} c_e x_e \\ 
    \text{subject to}\quad & \sum_{e\in \delta(S)} x_e \geq 1 
    \quad \text{for all $S \subseteq V$ such that $|S \cap \{s, t\}| = 1$} \\
    & x \geq \mathbf 0 \text{ and integer.}
\end{align*}
Here, we can assume that $x_e \in \{0, 1\}$ as this is a minimization problem,
and these values correspond to a choice of edges 
$F \subseteq E$. In particular, each constraint is equivalent to having 
$|F \cap \delta(S)| \geq 1$ for all $S \subseteq V$ with $|S \cap \{s, t\}| = 1$,
and the objective function is $c(F)$. Therefore, the shortest $s,t$-path can be 
modelled as a network design problem where the cut requirement function 
is given by 
\[ f(S) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } |S \cap \{s, t\}| = 1, \\ 
    0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases} \] 
Let's check that this choice of $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ really is a proper function.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item We have $f(V) = 0$ since $|V \cap \{s, t\}| = 2$. 
    \item This follows from the fact that if $s \in S$, then $s \notin V \setminus S$,
    and the same holds for $t$.
    \item Suppose towards a contradiction that there exist nonempty disjoint
    subsets $A, B \subseteq V$ such that $f(A \cup B) = 1$ and $f(A) = f(B) = 0$. 
    Then we have $|(A \cup B) \cap \{s, t\}| = 1$, which implies that 
    $A \cup B$ contains exactly one of $s$ or $t$. Without loss of generality, 
    suppose that $s \in A \cup B$ and $t \notin A \cup B$. Then we see that 
    $s$ must be in at least one of $A$ or $B$; without loss of generality, 
    suppose it is $A$. This implies that $s \in A$ and $t \notin A$, so 
    $f(A) = 1$, which is a contradiction.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Minimum cost Steiner trees.} The minimum cost Steiner tree problem
with respect to some set of terminals $T \subseteq V$ 
can be viewed as a network design problem where the cut requirement 
function is given by 
\[ f(S) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if $S \cap T \neq \varnothing$ and $S \cap T \neq T$}, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases} \] 
We check that this choice of $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ is proper. 
Conditions (i) and (ii) are clear, so we verify (iii). 

Suppose towards a contradiction that there are nonempty disjoint subsets $A, B \subseteq V$ 
such that $f(A \cup B) = 1$ and $f(A) = f(B) = 0$. This implies that 
$(A \cup B) \cap T \neq \varnothing$ and $(A \cup B) \cap T \neq T$. 
Since $A$ and $B$ are both subsets of $A \cup B$, it must be that 
$A \cap T \neq T$ and $B \cap T \neq T$. Moreover, since $(A \cup B) 
\cap T \neq \varnothing$, at least one of $A$ and $B$ must have 
nonempty intersection with $T$. Without loss of generality, we may assume 
that it is $A$. Then $A \cap T \neq \varnothing$ and $A \cap T \neq T$
so that $f(A) = 1$, which is a contradiction. 

{\bf Generalized minimum cost Steiner tree problem.} In this problem, 
we are given a graph $G = (V, E)$ and nonnegative costs $c_e \geq 0$ for all 
$e \in E$. Now, instead of just a single terminal $T \subseteq V$, 
we may be given multiple terminals $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_k \subseteq V$. Our 
goal is to minimize $c(F)$ over $F \subseteq E$, where for each $i = 1, \dots, k$, 
the vertices in $T_i$ are connected by the edges in $F$. 

For example, the graph below has three sets of terminals in blue, red, and green.
The bolded edges connect the vertices in all the terminals. We see that a 
subset which does this does not need to be connected itself, unlike the 
usual Steiner tree problem with one terminal.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={30mm}, main/.style = {draw, circle}] 
        \node[main, fill=blue] (1) at (4, 2) {}; 
        \node[main] (2) at (6, 1.5) {};
        \node[main, fill=red] (3) at (8, 1) {};
        \node[main, fill=blue] (4) at (6, 0.25) {};
        \node[main, fill=red] (5) at (3, -1.25) {};
        \node[main, fill=green] (6) at (5, -2) {};
        \node[main, fill=green] (7) at (7.5, -1.5) {};

        \draw [line width=2pt] (1) -- (2); \draw [line width=2pt] (2) -- (3);
        \draw [line width=2pt] (3) -- (4);
        \draw (1) -- (4); \draw (1) -- (5); 
        \draw [line width=2pt] (4) -- (5);
        \draw (4) -- (6); \draw (4) -- (7); \draw [line width=2pt] (6) -- (7);
    \end{tikzpicture} 
\end{center}\vspace{-0.25cm}
This problem can be formulated as a network design problem where the 
cut requirement function is
\[ f(S) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if there exists $i = 1, \dots, k$ such that 
    $S \cap T_i \neq \varnothing$ and $S \cap T_i \neq T_i$}, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases} \] 
The fact that $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ is a proper function can be shown 
similarly to above.

\subsection{LP Formulation of the Network Design Problem} \label{subsec:7.2}
From now on, we assume that the cut requirement function 
$f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ is proper. How do we solve network design problems 
under this assumption? This problem is $\NP$-hard in general 
since the Steiner tree problem is a special case of it. 
But we have nice approximation algorithms by way of linear programming. 

First, for ease of notation, we'll denote $\mathcal{K} = \{S \subseteq V : 
f(S) = 1\}$. Then the LP formulation of the network design problem, 
namely our primal LP (P), can be stated as follows. 
\begin{align*}
    \min\quad & \sum_{e\in E} c_e x_e \\ 
    \text{subject to}\quad & \sum_{e\in \delta(S)} x_e \geq 1 
    \quad \text{for all $S \in \mathcal{K}$} \\
    & x \geq \mathbf 0.
\end{align*}
Then the dual LP of (P), say (D), is given as follows.
\begin{align*}
    \max\quad & \sum_{S\in\mathcal{K}} 1 \cdot y_S \\ 
    \text{subject to}\quad & \sum_{S\in\mathcal{K}\,:\,e \in \delta(S)} y_S \leq c_e 
    \quad \text{for all $e\in E$} \\
    & y \geq \mathbf 0.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Iterative Rounding Approach} \label{subsec:7.3}
The iterative rounding approach for solving network design problems 
only makes use of the primal LP (P) above. The algorithm is
as follows: 
\begin{mdframed}[
    linewidth=1pt,
    linecolor=black,
    bottomline=false,topline=false,rightline=false,
    innerrightmargin=0pt,innertopmargin=0pt,innerbottommargin=0pt,
    innerleftmargin=1em,% Distance between vertical rule & proof content
    skipabove=0.75\baselineskip
]
{\bf Input.} A graph $G = (V, E)$, edge costs $c_e \geq 0$ for 
all $e \in E$, and a cut requirement function $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$. 

{\bf Output.} A set of edges $F \subseteq E$ with value close to the optimum.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.75cm, label={Step \arabic*.}]
    \item [{Step 0.}] Initialize $F \gets \varnothing$.
    \item Find an extreme optimal solution $\bar{x}$ for the primal LP
    (which can be done in polynomial time).

    \item Find $e' \in E$ such that $\bar{x}_{e'} = 0$ or $\bar{x}_{e'} \geq 1/2$.
    The existence of such an edge for $\bar{x}$ is guaranteed to 
    exist in the case where $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ is a proper function.

    \item If $\bar{x}_{e'} = 0$, then construct $G' = (V, E \setminus \{e\})$
    and keep the same costs for the remaining edges. 
    If $\bar{x}_{e'} \geq 1/2$, construct $G'$ from $G$ by contracting the 
    edge $e'$ and include $e'$ into $F$. 

    \item Recursively call the algorithm on $G'$ to obtain a solution $F'$. 
    Output $F \gets F' \cup F$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}\vspace{-0.25cm}
Note that the optimal value $\text{OPT}_{\text{primal IP}}$ for the network 
design problem is the optimal value of the primal LP (P) with added 
integrality constraints. By solving the primal LP, we only obtain 
the value $\text{OPT}_{\text{primal LP}}$, which gives us a lower
bound on the desired value via
\[ \text{OPT}_{\text{primal LP}} \leq \text{OPT}_{\text{primal IP}} \] 
since this is a minimization problem and any feasible solution to the IP is 
also feasible for the LP. It turns out that the iterative rounding 
approach produces a solution of cost at most $2 \cdot \text{OPT}_{\text{primal LP}}$
and hence at most $2 \cdot \text{OPT}_{\text{primal IP}}$. In particular, 
the iterative rounding approach is a $2$-approximation algorithm for the 
network design problem.

We won't prove that an edge $e' \in E$ such that $\bar{x}_{e'} = 0$ 
or $\bar{x}_{e'} \geq 1/2$ always exists when $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ is a 
proper function, as this is quite difficult. For the analysis, we'll assume 
this fact and show that the solution obtained of the algorithm is within a 
factor of $2$ of the optimum. This can be proven by induction on the number 
of edges $|E|$. 

{\bf Case 1.} Suppose that $\bar{x}_{e'} = 0$. Then the solution 
$x^*_e := \bar{x}_e$ for all $e \in E \setminus \{e'\}$ is still feasible 
for the LP constructed for $G' = (V, E \setminus \{e'\})$. By 
induction, we have that 
\[ c(F') \leq 2 \cdot \text{OPT}_{\text{primal LP for $G'$}} \leq 
2 \cdot \sum_{e \in E} c_e \bar{x}_e \leq 2 \cdot \text{OPT}_{\text{primal LP}}, \] 
where $F'$ is the output of the algorithm for $G'$.

{\bf Case 2.} Suppose that $\bar{x}_{e'} \geq 1/2$. Then the solution 
$x_e^* := \bar{x}_e$ for all $e \in E \setminus \{e'\}$ is still feasible 
for the LP constructed for $G'$ obtained by contracting $e'$ in $G$. 
By induction, we have that 
\[ c(F') \leq 2 \cdot \text{OPT}_{\text{primal LP for $G'$}} \leq 
2 \cdot \sum_{e \in E \setminus \{e'\}} c_e \bar{x}_e, \]
where $F'$ is the output of the algorithm for $G'$. Afterwards, we output 
$F' \cup \{e'\}$ for $G$, and we see that 
\[ c(F' \cup \{e'\}) \leq 2 \cdot \sum_{e \in E \setminus \{e'\}} c_e \bar{x}_E
+ c'_e \leq 2 \cdot \sum_{e \in E} c_e \bar{x}_e \] 
since $c_{e'} \leq 2c_{e'} \bar{x}_{e'}$ by the choice of $e'$, as desired. 

\subsection{Primal-Dual Approach} \label{subsec:7.4}
We now give another approximation algorithm for solving the network 
design problem, this time making use of the dual LP. The idea is to 
construct a feasible solution $y$ for the dual LP; based on this 
dual solution $y$, we construct the output $F \subseteq E$. Suppose we 
could argue that 
\[ c(F) \leq \alpha \cdot \sum_{S \in \mathcal{K}} y_S \] 
where $\sum_{S \in \mathcal{K}} y_S$ is the value of the dual solution $y$ 
and $\alpha \geq 1$ is some constant. We see that 
\[ \sum_{S\in\mathcal{K}} y_S \leq \text{OPT}_{\text{primal LP}} \leq 
\text{OPT}_{\text{primal IP}} \] 
where the first inequality is due to weak duality. This gives rise to an
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm.

The primal-dual approach is based on the notion of continuous growth. 
Over a time period, we pick some values $y_S$ where $S \in \mathcal{K}$
and increase them at the same rate, while the other values are kept fixed. 
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item At a time period, how do we select the subsets $S \in \mathcal{K}$ 
    for which to increase the values $y_S$?
    \item When do we stop increasing the values for the currently 
    selected sets $S \in \mathcal{K}$?
\end{enumerate}
To answer the first question, we will pick all the inclusion-wise minimal sets 
$S \in {\cal K}$ such that $\delta(S) \cap F = \varnothing$. In other words, 
these are the sets $S \subseteq V$ such that $f(S) = 1$ and $\delta(S) \cap F 
= \varnothing$, with the property that any proper subset $S' \subsetneq S$ will have 
$f(S') = 0$ or $\delta(S') \cap F \neq \varnothing$. 

Let $\mathcal{B} := \{S \in \mathcal{K} : \delta(S) \cap F = \varnothing\}$. 
We call $\mathcal{B}$ the collection of violated sets. Let
$\mathcal{D}$ be the collection of minimal sets in $\mathcal{B}$. The following 
lemma tells us that $\mathcal{D}$ can be efficiently computed.

\begin{lemma}{lemma:7.1} 
    For every $F \subseteq E$, we have that 
    \[ \mathcal{D} = \{S \subseteq V : \text{$S$ is a connected component of $(V, F)$ 
    such that $f(S) = 1$}\}. \]
\end{lemma}\vspace{-0.25cm}
\begin{pf}[Lemma~\ref{lemma:7.1}]
    $(\subseteq)$  Let $S_1, \dots, S_k$ denote the connected components of $(V, F)$, 
    and let $S \subseteq V$. If $S \cap S_i \neq \varnothing$ and 
    $S \cap S_i \neq S_i$, then we have $F \cap \delta(S) \neq \varnothing$. 
    In particular, for any $S \in \mathcal{B}$, we have that 
    \[ S = \bigcup_{j \in J} S_j \] 
    for some $J \subseteq \{1, \dots, k\}$. Since $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$ 
    is a proper function, we have 
    \[ f(S) \leq \max_{j\in J} f(S_j). \] 
    Let $S \in \mathcal{D}$ so that $S$ is a minimal set in $\mathcal{B}$.
    By the above discussion, we can write $S = \bigcup_{j\in J} S_j$ for 
    some $J \subseteq \{1, \dots, k\}$. Since $f(S) = 1$, we see that 
    $f(S_j) = 1$ for some $j \in J$. Then $S_j$ is a connected component 
    of $(V, F)$, which implies that $\delta(S_j) \cap F = \varnothing$. 
    Therefore, $S_j$ is a violated set. Since $S$ is minimal, 
    it must be that $S = S_j$ for some $j = 1, \dots, k$, so $S$ 
    is a connected component of $(V, F)$. 

    $(\supseteq)$ Suppose that $S$ is a connected component of $(V, F)$. 
    Then $\delta(S) \cap F = \varnothing$, so $S$ is a violated set. 
    But for every nonempty proper subset $S' \subsetneq S$, we have 
    $\delta(S') \cap F \neq \varnothing$ because inside the connected 
    component, considering the cut induced by some proper subset of vertices 
    gives rise to an edge. This implies that $S$ must be minimal, so 
    we are done. \qed 
\end{pf}\vspace{-0.25cm}

As a consequence, we obtain the following corollary. 

\begin{cor}{cor:7.2}
    A subset $F \subseteq E$ is a feasible solution to the network design 
    problem if and only if for every component $S$ of $(V, F)$, 
    we have $f(S) = 0$. 
\end{cor}\vspace{-0.25cm}

Now, let's consider the question of when to stop increasing the values of $y_S$. 
As stated before, we will increase the values of $y_S$ for all $S \in \mathcal{D}$
at the same rate, and leave $y_S$ for $S \notin \mathcal{D}$ unchanged. 
We do this until there is an edge $e \in E$ such that $e \in \delta(S)$ 
for some $S \in \mathcal{D}$ and 
\[ \sum_{S\in\mathcal{K}\,:\,e\in\delta(S)} y_S = c_e. \] 
That is, the corresponding constraint for $e \in E$ in the dual LP becomes tight. 
In this case, we call the edge $e$ {\bf tight}. Once we stop, we will 
include all the tight edges into $F$. 

Putting everything together, the primal-dual approach to solve network 
design problems is as follows.

\begin{mdframed}[
    linewidth=1pt,
    linecolor=black,

]
{\bf Input.} A graph $G = (V, E)$, edge costs $c_e \geq 0$ for 
all $e \in E$, and a cut requirement function $f : 2^V \to \{0, 1\}$. 

{\bf Output.} A set of edges $F \subseteq E$ with value close to the optimum.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.75cm, label={Step \arabic*.}]
    \item Let $F = \varnothing$ and let $y_S = 0$ for all $S \in \mathcal{K}$.
    Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the collection of minimal violated sets with respect 
    to $F$. (At this stage, these are the isolated vertices.)

    \item While $\mathcal{D} \neq \varnothing$:
    \begin{enumerate}[label={Step 2.\arabic*.}]
        \item Increase $y_S$ for $S \in \mathcal{D}$ at the same rate 
        until some edge $e \in E$ becomes tight.
        \item Update $F := F \cup T$ where $T$ is the set of all tight edges. 
        Update $\mathcal{D}$ with respect to this new $F$. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item {\bf (Reverse delete.)} Let $F = \{e_1, \dots, e_k\}$ where the 
    index corresponds to the order that the edges were inserted to $F$. 
    Iterate backwards through the list; that is, start from $i = k$ 
    and go down to $i = 1$. For each $i$, if $F \setminus \{e_i\}$ is feasible 
    for the network design problem, update $F := F \setminus \{e_i\}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}\vspace{-0.25cm}
